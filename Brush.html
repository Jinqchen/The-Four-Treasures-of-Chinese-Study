      <p>Among all kinds of pen products, the writing brush is unique to China. The traditional writing brush is not
        only a necessary tool for the study of ancient people, but also has a unique charm in expressing the special
        flavor of Chinese calligraphy and painting. However, because the brush is fragile and difficult to preserve,
        there are very few ancient brushes that have been handed down till now. There are many varieties of ancient
        pens. From the raw materials of pens, there were rabbit hair, mouse hair, Wolf hair and so on. According to the
        quality of the pen tube, there are jade, crystal, gold, silver, wood and so on. The earliest writing brushes can
        be traced back to more than 2,000 years ago. In the Western Zhou Dynasty, although no writing brush has been
        found up to now, some signs of writing brush can be found from the prehistoric colored pottery patterns and the
        oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty.</p>
