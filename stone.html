      <p>Although inkstone ranks in the ranks of "pen, ink, paper and inkstone", it is in the leading position in a
        certain sense. The so-called "Four Treasures" inkstone comes first. This is because of its solid texture and its
        ability to be handed down for a hundred generations. Therefore, in the "Four Treasures" in today's society,
        inkstone is the most common and the most widely loved. When was the earliest inkstone made in China? What's the
        difference between it and the inkstone we use? Archaeologists once found a set of tools used by primitive people
        for pottery painting in a site of primitive society in Jiangzhai, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province. Among them,
        there is a piece of stone with a cover, the surface of the stone is slightly hollow, and there is a stone
        grindstone pestle beside it, and several pieces of black pigment are retained. Obviously, this is the shape and
        system of the early inkstone with the help of the pestle to grind pigment. As the site belonged to the Yangshao
        Culture of the matriarchal clan, the actual age of the inkstone was more than five thousand years. Ink-stone
        with the shape of the pestle or grind stone from what time to begin to change, that is, to cancel the pestle or
        grind stone, and close to the inkstone? Not until the Han Dynasty. In the Han Dynasty, because of the invention
        of artificial ink, ink can be ground directly on the inkstone, so it is no longer necessary to grind natural or
        semi-natural ink with a pestle or stone. In this way, the pestle or stone grinding gradually disappeared after
        more than three thousand years of trekking in prehistory and in the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. Although it
        is no longer useful, its contribution to the dissemination of culture is still indispensable.</p>
