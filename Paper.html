      <p>Paper is one of the four great inventions of ancient China. Even in the machine paper prevailing today, some
        traditional handmade paper still reflects its irreplaceable role, coruscate unique brilliance. Ancient paper can
        still be seen in the ancient calligraphy and painting handed down. What did people use as a record material long
        before the invention of paper? According to literature and material materials, the earliest people used knots to
        keep track of events. When things happened, they tied a knot and then went away. Later, they carved words on the
        bones of tortoiseshell beasts, so called "oracle bone inscriptions". After bronze came into being, inscriptions
        were carved on the bronze ware, namely "jinwen" or "zhongding wen". Then, the words are written on the pieces
        made of bamboo and wood, which are called "bamboo and wood slips". If the thick bamboo and wood slips are called
        "slips". At the same time, some are also written on the silk products. Before the pre-Qin period, in addition to
        the above-mentioned record materials, there were also inscriptions carved on stones, such as the famous "stone
        drum inscriptions".</p>
