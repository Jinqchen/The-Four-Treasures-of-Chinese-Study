      <p>The four treasures of the study are unique calligraphy and painting tools (calligraphy and painting tools) in
        China, namely brush, ink, paper and inkstone. The name of the Four Treasures of the Study originated in the
        Southern and Northern Dynasties. The Four Treasures is expressed in a four word couplet: "文房四寶: 筆、墨、紙、硯,"
        (Pinyin: wén fáng sì bǎo: bǐ, mò, zhǐ, yàn) "The four jewels of the study: Brush, Ink, Paper, Inkstone.”In the
        couplet mentioned, each of the Treasures is referred to by a single epithet; however, each of these are usually
        known by a compound name (i.e. The Brush: 毛筆, literally "hair brush/pen). The individual treasures have a
        "treasured" form, each being produced in certain areas of China as a specialty for those scholars who would use
        them.</p>
